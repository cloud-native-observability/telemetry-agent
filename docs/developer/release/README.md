# Releasing

This document describes the process of creating a release for the
`grafana/agent` repo. A release includes release assets for everything inside
the repository, including Grafana Agent and Grafana Agent Operator.

The processes described here are for v0.24.0 and above.

# Prerequisites

These [Prerequisites](./prerequisites.md) should be done by the release shepherd 
before taking any actions.

# Workflows

Once a release is scheduled, a release shepherd is determined. This person will be 
responsible for ownership of the following workflows:

- Release Candidate Publish
  - [Actions] 1-4,6-7,9
- Additional Release Candidate[s] Publish
  - [Actions] 2-4,6-7,9
- Stable Release Publish
  - [Actions] 2-9
- Patch Release Publish (latest version)
  - [Actions] 2-6,8-9
- Patch Release Publish (older version)
  - Not documented yet (but here are some hints)
      - somewhat similar to Patch Release Publish (latest version)
      - find the old release branch
      - cherry-pick commit[s] into it
      - don't update the version in the project on main
      - changes go into the changelog under the patch release version plus stay in unreleased
      - don't update the `release` branch
      - don't publish in github as latest release
      - don't update deployment tools or helm charts

# Release Cycle

A typical release cycle is to have a Release Candidate published for at least 48 
hours followed by a Stable Release. 0 or more Patch Releases may occur between the Stable Release
and the creation of the next Release Candidate.

```

RCV = Release Candidate Version

SRV = Stable Release Version

PRV = Patch Release Version
